# projects

## glitch[dot]cool

A collaborative blog developed for an audiovisual collective bearing the same name as the url. It is built with Gatsby, React, and GraphQL, uses Contentful as a CMS, and deploys to Netlify via continuous integration.

## symphinity

A collaboration between Data Science and Web students at Lambda School, built in 4 days. Symphinity connects to the Spotify API and uses a custom machine learning implementation to generate music suggestions. The web portion of the project consists of a React front-end deployed to Netlify and powered by a Node/Express/Postgresql backend deployed to Heroku. The data science portion of the project was built with Jupyter Notebook and deployed to a Flask app running on Heroku.

## key conservation

A collaboration between 5 separate cohorts of Lambda School students and a group of developers at UC San Diego, Key Conservation is a mobile app that pairs supporters with environmental conservation efforts worldwide. It is built with React Native and Redux on the front end, and Node.js, Express, Knex, and Postgresql on the back end, deployed to Heroku with a CI/CD pipeline.

## patch.exchange

An in-development full-stack application designed for "creative coders" - users of languages/frameworks like max/msp, puredata, touchdesigner, processing, etc. Patch.exchange allows users to upload and distribute "patches" (small programs), with support for file versioning. Think of it as NPM meets bandcamp. It is built with Node.js, Express, Knex.js, and a Postgresql database on the backend, with a React frontend that uses Redux for state management and styled-components for styling. The ambition is to have an accompanying Electron desktop application that can synchronize patch versions to specific projects, inspired by NPM's `package.json` system.

## aleph

A cross-platform desktop application and programming framework that allows users to easily create and perform audio-reactive visuals with MIDI. It is built with Electron and deeply integrates with the creative coding framework p5.js. Future updates will include integration with three.js for more complex 3D rendering capabilities and integration into patch.exchange for seamless sharing of user created "patches".

## droenbot

A Node.js based discord bot custom built to support two online communities of digital creatives. Droenbot features include voting, fetching data from various APIs, a directory system, a challenge system for issuing creative prompts, server moderation, and other useful features.

## bend

A custom photobooth installation built for a music festival. It runs on a raspberry pi with a camera attachment and custom software written in Processing and Bash, housed in a wooden enclosure. bend takes a photo of the user then gradually corrupts the image through a process known as "databending" - individual bytes of the image data are randomly rewritten, corrupting the image and producing a deliberate "glitch" effect.
