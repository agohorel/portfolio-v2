  Oko is an on-demand education & staffing solution for cannabis businesses.
  Prospective workers enroll in online courses, gain certification, and are
  entered into a pool of available workers. 


  Businesses can create listings for upcoming gigs and send out offers via SMS to workers. Employers can track payouts and generate critical documents for compliance, as well as hire contract workers for fulltime roles.


  My contributions to the app include developing a real-time notification system comprising SMS, email, and in-app notifications, creating a reusable virtualized table component, and leading development on an updated design system after a complete rebrand.
