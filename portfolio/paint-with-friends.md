  Pï»¿aint with Friends is a multiplayer drawing application that allows users to
  virtually "paint" together in realtime, with cursor-tracking to show who is
  drawing what (think Figma). It also supports chat and a realtime presence
  system, indicating who is online. The app provides fairly standard drawing
  options (color, stroke width, size, etc.) and shapes (line, ellipse, square,
  custom text) but has a secret weapon, borrowed from the world of audio
  production - low frequency oscillators (LFOs)! LFOs are a form of control
  signal that can be used to control other signals - in this case the parameters
  of your virtual "brush". The LFOs are fully configurable (frequency,
  amplitude, floor, and shape), can target nearly any drawing parameter, and can
  even be chained together for interesting and sometimes unexpected effects. 


  I started this project to mentor a friend who was interested in learning web development, and to that end the project is in most ways done "the old fashioned way" (sans the inclusion of Typescript) - that is no UI framework and no fancy automated deployments via a service like Netlify or Vercel. Just static HTML pages, vanilla JS (well...TS) to manage the DOM, and manual deployments to a cheap Linode server using Certbot and Nginx. The backend is Express + Socket.io and the frontend uses p5.js for rendering.


  One interesting problem we had to solve while working on this project was the issue of preserving the state of the canvas on the server, such that a returning client would be "up to speed" with the current state of the remote canvas. We settled on a somewhat novel approach - running a virtual "canvas" on the serverside (using JSDOM) which updates itself in realtime as the canvas changes. When a user first joins, the serverside canvas returns a serialized version of the image data which the client first renders, and then draws on top of. 


  Lastly, I added some integration with our Discord bot, droenbot. Users in the glitch.cool server can call a command to instantly print out the current state of the canvas, right in Discord. I used the Sharp image processing library to generate both thumbnail (used in the Discord embed) and full-size images (which the embeds link directly to). Generated images are cached in memory on the server for quick response times, and invalidated when users update the state of the canvas.
