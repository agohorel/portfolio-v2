  Aleph is a cross-platform desktop application and programming framework
  designed for developing and performing audio-reactive visuals using browser
  technologies. The aim of the project is to make programming approachable for
  artists and musicians while allowing for more complex usage by more advanced
  programmers.


  Aleph leverages the simplicity of working with HTML Canvas and WebGL that p5.js provides, wraps it in a self-contained app with loads of helpful utilities designed to accelerate development, and provides a custom MIDI implementation that allows for expressive live performances.
