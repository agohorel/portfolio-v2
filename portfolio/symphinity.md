  Aleph is a cross-platform desktop application and programming framework
  designed for developing and performing audio-reactive visuals using browser
  technologies. Originally built with Processing, a descendant of Java, Aleph
  was rebuilt with p5.js and Electron to tap into the robust ecosystem of web
  technologies and to make it more accessible to users.


  Aleph leverages the simplicity of working with HTML Canvas and WebGL that p5.js provides, wraps it in a self-contained app with loads of helpful utilities designed to accelerate development, and provides a custom MIDI implementation that allows for expressive live performances.




  Symphinity is a full-stack web application that generates music recommendations and allows users to save their favorite songs. It is built around a machine learning model trained off ~200k songs from Spotify's library and connects with the Spotify API, giving users access to a massive library of music.
