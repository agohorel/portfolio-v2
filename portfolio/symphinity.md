  Symphinity is a full-stack web application that generates music
  recommendations from Spotify's API and allows users to save their favorite
  songs. It is built around a machine learning model trained off ~200k songs
  from Spotify's library, but provides access to the full library of millions of
  songs.




  Symphinity was built in two 4-day sprints by a cross-functional international team of students at Lambda School. The machine learning API was developed by Data Science students who I worked with closely to deliver compatible front and back ends to the application. I worked with a team of 3 to develop the front end in one four day sprint, and worked with one other developer to develop the back end in another four day sprint.
