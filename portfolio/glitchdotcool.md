  glitch\[dot]cool is an audiovisual arts collective I co-founded in 2019 with
  friends I made running a prior label called Outlier Recordings. We currently
  have nearly two dozen members spanning the globe, working in a wide range of
  contemporary art forms.


  Our website is a progressive web app built w/ Gatsby and deployed w/ continuous integration to Netlify. We currently have 10 contributors to the site who post content using Contentful CMS. I also set up Matomo, an open source privacy-respecting analytics solution, which runs on a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack deployed to Linode. To date the site has attracted nearly 20k visitors and has served over 3k downloads of our royalty-free sample packs.


  We also have an active Discord server w/ over 250 members which I developed a bot for, which I continue to maintain.
