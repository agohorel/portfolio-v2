description: Bend is a bespoke photobooth installation made for Anomalia
  Festival that runs on a Raspberry Pi mounted to a wooden enclosure that holds
  an LCD display. It runs an application written in Processing (Java) which
  iteratively corrupts the images it takes, displaying them in sequence to the
  user as their image becomes progressively more distorted.
