  Key Conservation is a React-Native mobile application that connects
  environmental conservation organizations with everyday people who want to lend
  a helping hand. Organizations can create campaigns to raise awareness, funds,
  or to call for volunteer assistance with conservation efforts. On the other
  side of the equation, supporters can follow organizations in their area to
  receive real-time updates on conversation efforts.


  Key Conservation is a non-profit organization based in California. The development of the app has been a collaboration between Lambda School students, university students at UC San Diego, and Key Conservation's own team of developers.


  My major contribution to the app was leading technical and logistics research into global payment services to allow for in-app donations. I created test environments to experiment with APIs from Braintree and Paypal and extensively researched other payment providers. Our other major goal during our product cycle was to increase interactions by supporters. To this end, I contributed a "bookmark" feature that allows users to save and recall campaign posts to better stay in touch, and assisted in adding a feature that allows supporters to react to campaigns with emojis.
