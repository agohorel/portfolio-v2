  My take on John Conway's classic "Game of Life" cellular automaton. There are
  two rendering modes, 2D and 3D, both representing the same underlying
  two-dimensional Game of Life simulation. Cells are colored based on their age,
  and in the 3D mode the cells' height also represents their age. In both modes
  the user can generate random starting distributions or draw in their own.




  This project was originally written in 4 days using vanilla Javascript, HTML canvas, and WebGL via the lovely p5.js library. I had a blast working on this and really came to appreciate the beauty of the unlikely complexity that arises from just a handful of simple rules.
